## 🚀 PRODIGY_CS_01  
**Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool (Tkinter GUI)**  

This project was developed as part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, under the role of **Cyber Security Intern**.  
The task was to build a Caesar Cipher encryption/decryption tool using Python with a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using **Tkinter**.

## 🧠 About Caesar Cipher

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the oldest and simplest known encryption techniques.  
It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

**Example:**
